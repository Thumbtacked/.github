## About

Thumbtacked is an open-source all-in-one producivity app I work on in my free time.

The philosiphy is to focus on the visual aspect. This means you can drag cards and widgets around in your workspace, links things together into projects, put things into tabs, etc. This helps you keep your note taking and task planning process simple.

Another important aspect is that the app will always be open, extensible, and free. This means the entire stack and code will be public and you'll be able to integrate with the API to customize functionality.
