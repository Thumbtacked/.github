## About

Thumbtacked is an all-in-one producivity app I'm developing, which attempts to make organization more enjoyable.

The purpose of the app is to let your tasks and ideas visually organized and interconnected, allowing you to stay creative and proudctive. This is achived through hierarchical pages, draggable widgets, nested tasks, and a powerful hyperlink system. A benifit of this structure is that it allows a wide variety of use cases and setups.

Additionally, it's open, extensible, and free. This means all source code will be public and you'll be able to integrate with the API to customize functionality.
